# Practice problems

#### Here there are three sections, two practice problems and one class to make

## Problem 1: Easy
#### Greatest common factor
* For this problem, you have to write a method that takes two integer parameters, x and y, and use them to return the greatest common factor between them.\
`EX: gcf(20, 12) would return 4.`
* 
## Problem 2: Medium
#### Cut the String
* Here, write a method that takes an array of String and make a new array that takes each string, and only has the first and last letters\
  `EX: ["Hello", "darkness", "my", "old", "friend"] would become ["Ho", "ds", "my", "od", "fd"]`

## Problem 3: Hard
### Timer Class
* So this one is a little different. Here, you should go into Timer.java file to fill out an all the methods laid out. All the prompts are in the file itself.
